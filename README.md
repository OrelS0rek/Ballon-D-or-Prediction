# Ballon-D-or-Prediction

*objective*

trying to Predict the Winner of the Ballon D'Or with a machine learning model using NO libraries, and purely math, numpy and pandas.
my main goals with this project are predicting the ballon d'or winners. and learning about how linear regression works without using  a black box like sklearn that uses the algorithms without teaching me.

*data selection*


the full data will be available on kaggle soon.
i scraped the data from multiple sites containing data for :
* regurlar player stats, champions league player stats and world cup player stats
* ballon d'or winners and nominees and percent of votes each year.
here are the links of all websites i used:



*Exploratory Data Analysis*

for this section i had to use one library - matplotlib, because i cant compute plots without using libraries.
i plotted some scatter plots to help me visualize the data and some correlation plots.
all plots are available in the 'Plots' directory of the repository.
